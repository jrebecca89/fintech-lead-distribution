# Fintech Lead Distribution Dashboard

## Objective  
This project analyzes the efficiency of lead assignments in a fintech sales team. The goal is to uncover whether sales reps perform better with leads that match their strengths — and to visualize response patterns across reps and lead profiles.

## Key Metrics  
- **Match vs Mismatch Close Rate** – Compare close rates based on whether the rep’s profile matches the lead’s.
- **Avg Response Time (Days)** – Average number of days it takes a rep to respond.
- **Total Hours Spent** – Total time spent following up with leads.
- **Lead Profile** – High/Low Credit & High/Low Income filters for slicing performance trends.

## Tools  
- Power BI  
- DAX  
- Excel (for data prep)
